# Prime-D
This KiCad project includes both the schematic and pcb-layout for FSI drop tower project "Prime-D".  This circuit board should be treated as an Arduino "Shield" and be placed on top of the Arduino Uno socket.

## Usage
This project requires KiCad Version 5.0 and after to use.

## Documents Folder
The documents folder contains;
  * the bill of materials (BOM)
  * all of the components datasheets
  * gerber files
  * pictures
  * previous revisions
  * pdf of both the schematic and pcb layout

## Coming Soon
Again please note that this Prime-D circuit board should be treated as an Arduino Uno shield.  The software to program the arduino will be added to this repo soon.
